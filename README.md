# PyOWM API - World Wide Rain Weather Information

## Project Overview

This project is a Python API developed to gather real-time rainfall data from a variety of global cities and geographic coordinates. It is designed to be integrated with a network simulator to analyze the impact of rainfall on satellite communications. By incorporating this environmental data, the simulator can make more informed and adaptive routing decisions, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of satellite-based networks.

## Run Instructions

Make sure you have Python installed. You will also need the following packages:

- **Math, Pandas**: Used to manipulate data.
- **Json**: Used to export weather-related information to a JSON file, based on the user's choice.
- **Os**: Utilized to access internal paths.
- **Requests:** Used to make requests to OpenWeather API.
- **Pprint:** Used for printing the weather-related information in a better way.

To run this API you will need to generate a new OpenWeather API key and place it on:

```bash
ForecastWeather.py
DataIntroduction.py
CurrenttWeather.py
```

After all configuration being setted up, run:

```bash
Main.py
```
